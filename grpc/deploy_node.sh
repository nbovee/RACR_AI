#!/bin/bash

# deploy_node.sh - Runs (after building, if an image doesn't already exist) a
# client or remote node for cooperative DNN inference. Here, "node" refers to a
# Docker container running on either a Jetson, Raspberry Pi, or PC, which
# communicates with other nodes on the network using the gRPC protocol.
#
# USAGE:
#		./deploy_node [FLAGS] SUFFIX
#
# FLAGS:
# 	-n		"no CUDA"	  Use for hosts without CUDA support (like the Pi 3)
#	  -r		"remote"	  Deploys a remote/server host (rather than client)
#	  -a		"arm64"		  Use for arm64 hosts (default is x86)
#	  -t		"terminal"	Opens an interactive terminal session inside the container
#
# SUFFIX
#			The suffix is a required argument that tells the script how to find
#			which Dockerfile to use from the Dockerfiles directory. (The only
#			difference between the filenames is the suffix).
#
#			The base image has the correct Python and PyTorch dependencies installed;
#			all that's really left to do is specify the script you'd like to execute
#			when the container is run, including any extra setup you want to include
#			in the Dockerfile before that.
#
#			When choosing a suffix for your Dockerfile, try to make it descriptive
#			as it will be used to tag the final image as well.
